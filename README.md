Financial fraud is a severe problem
that could cost people and organizations a lot of
money. The demand to create ef icient fraud
detection systems is growing as more financial
transactions are being done online. Machine
learning algorithms have been demonstrated to
be useful in the detection of fraud because they
can quickly spot patterns and abnormalities in
big datasets. This study investigates the
application of supervised and unsupervised
learning algorithms for financial fraud
prediction. We examine several datasets, such as
bank transactions, insurance claims, and credit
card transactions. I have examined various
datasets, such as credit card transactions and
Blockchain. Our studies' findings demonstrate
that machine learning algorithms may ef ectively
identify fraudulent transactions with a high
degree of precision, giving financial institutions a
useful tool to fight fraud.
